Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A: Tesselating hexagons are like making geometric land masses while tesselating rooms and hallways is like making a labyrinth or maze.

-----
Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A: Find an overarching geometric pattern for the layout of your world and break up the smaller shapes into columns.
Make a method that finds the starting position of the next shape you want to draw and then make a method that draws each column.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: A room has intersecting walls of tiles, while a hall does not.

-----
Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: I used the same implementation as the one from lab.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A: Draw a room at a start position, given the dimensions of the entrance or entrances of the room, draw a hallway that leads to each
entrance. Given the end positions of each hallway, draw a room at each end position. Repeat this process until there is a sufficient
amount of rooms and hallways.
