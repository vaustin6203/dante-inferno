# Dante's Inferno Game
A two-person project where we designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration engine inspired by Dante's Inferno! This game has three levels you have to
beat in order to win the game. Each level is inspired by a level in Hell from Dante's Inferno. This game requires strategy to ensure your player has enough energy
to traverse the randomly generated labyrinths on each level. Once you reach the portal at the end of the maze, you must fight the boss demon in order to be transported to 
the next level. Each level increases in difficulty. The tiles and characters in the game were created and deisgned by me in Photoshop.
